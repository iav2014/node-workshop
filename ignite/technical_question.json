release involves the introduction of new functionalities related to the management of invoices in the finance module. this is a complex change as it affects critical systems; sap uses alfresco as the content management system (refer to section 6.2 from the technical specifications for more information). all invoices introduced in the erp (around 10.000 per year) end up in the content management system (cms). the cms is also a key system for euipo as it stores all the administrative documentation from the office (millions of documents) which is accessed on daily basis from all euipo’s staff. the cms is maintained by a different contractor. the new functionalities to be delivered have been described very high level in the request for change document and need further clarification from users. the functionalities will introduce new workflows therefore some training for the financial department is also expected. the office has requested you to deliver a package with these new functionality changes.  considering that you will receive the rfc document and that the quality team will provide you with a master test agreement (mta) document, please produce a list of technical
